Add-Ons
=======
These are additional libraries that work with TensorFlow.js but need to be installed separately.
[TFJS VIS](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-vis/)
An add-on library for TensorFlow.JS that provides in browser visualization capabilities. Easily see model information, training metrics and evaluate model quality
See our demo showing how to[monitor training](https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-vis/mnist/dist/index.html), or look at the[internals of a digit recognizer.](https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-vis/mnist_internals/dist/index.html)
